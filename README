Welcome to the "BlockLoreSaver" plugin.
I created this plugin because I want to create a Minecraft server.

It's very unlikely that there will be frequent updates.
By the way, and yes, the plugin is from Germany.

Instructions:
- Install Maven
Here's the link:
https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
- Run the following command in the project folder:
"mvn clean package"
- A .jar file will appear in the /Target folder.

Download it to your plugins folder.

License:
- You may upload it anywhere with this link.
- You may not claim it as your own.
- You may not earn anything from it.
Otherwise, do what you want. ^^
