Welcome to my plugin :D

This plugin saves lore and renames even after the block has been placed and removed.

This plugin is not added with something like /rename.
We therefore recommend:
- Essentials | /itemrename or /itemlore
- Itemedit | /ie rename or /ie lore

If you notice any bugs, please report them in the upcoming Discord server!

Other information:
This plugin actually supports a LOT of versions.
Just give it a try!

If you see this message in the console,
the plugin is activated!:

I hope this solved one of your problems!

And for the Open Source Place:
